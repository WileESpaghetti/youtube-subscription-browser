dashboard with information about your youtube subscriptions

# Prerequisites
You will need to activate the YouTube data API and set up OAuth credentials.
I used the instructions from the Go quickstart: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/quickstart/go
to get the `client_secret.json` file.

The `client_secret.json` file will need to be in the same directory as the final executables.
